Driftworld Tectonics is a project written for Unity editor, used to create basic forms of planets. It utilizes ideas and methods described in an article by Yann Cortial et al. in 2019 \cite{cortial}. Planets are created by~reading basic template topology, performing a simplified tectonic simulation of the planet's crust and~then exporting the raw data to customized binary files. Users can display various overlays of the~planet during the simulation, as well as see the surface elevation mesh.\par
This documentation describes some basic theoretical framework, details of the simulation and the implementation. Hopefully it can be of use to anyone interested in this topic, who either just wants to play around with Driftworld or build their own projects.\par
