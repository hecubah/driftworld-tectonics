\section*{Disclaimer}

Over the past two years, Driftworld evolved both in terms of ideas and terms of implementation. The absolute majority of concepts beyond mathematics were completely new to me when the project started, so the code changed often and many times was almost completely rewritten as I learned. Some older parts remained which can cause a correct impression of inhomogeneity. I do not claim the implementation is flawless and although a lot of the shaky cases were accounted for, some unforseen mistakes may and probably do remain.

I would like to ask anyone using the project to tolerate possible mistakes. There is more work to be done and I would be grateful for feedback.

Thank you for your consideration.
