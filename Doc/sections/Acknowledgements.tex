I would like to thank Dr. Yann Cortial of the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon for discussing his article. His answers to my various inquiries helped me decide the scope and form of Driftworld. I would also like to thank Dr. Daniel Meister of AMD Japan Co. Ltd. for his comments on the use of bounding volume hiearchy algorithms. Driftworld implements a part of an algorithm described in one of his publications \cite{meister}. More thanks to \href{https://www.prowaretech.com}{PROWAREtech} for allowing me to include an adapted version of an example implementation of Mersenne Twister random number generator in the project.

I would like to thank Ben Golus for his help with UV texture mapping and his advice on texturing. %href??

Special thanks to my friends Vilém and Matyáš and other members of our Discord server for discussing ideas and for their feedback.

The project was created using Unity Editor, lately in its version 2021.3.1f1. The C\# code is kept in a~MS Visual Studio Community 2022 project, image materials come from Unity Editor screenshots, Geogebra projects, Blender and Dia. Documentation uses \LaTeX\hspace*{0.3em}in its TeX Live implementation.
